Hi , I'm Kathy and I have a passion for animals.  It has been a lifelong dream to one day have my own exotics pet store. 
I went to college for Business management and worked in the pet industry for 15 years.  
Outside of working in the pet undustry I was fostering exotic animals until they wentt to their forever homes.
I have been breeding crested Gecko's as a small hobby for years, and recently started breeding Tokay gecko's.
I have been researching genetics and can't wait to discover or refine genes within Tokay's.
Next spring I will start breeding corn snakes, and perhaps the following year I will breed garter snakes as well.
I have experience as a reptile, birds and small animal specialist for 15 years.
I am certified in dog training for obedience, trick training, K-9 good citizen, hunting and service animal's.
I am certified in K-9 and Feline nutrician.
